How to release a new version of SemanticScuttle
===============================================

0. Run unit tests and verify that all of them pass
1. Update doc/ChangeLog
2. Update version in data/templates/about.tpl.php
3. Create a release zip file via the build script:
   Just type "phing".
4. Make a test installation from your zip file with a fresh
   database. Register a user, add bookmarks etc.
5. When all is fine, it's time to release.
   The build script takes care for most of the
   tasks.
   Run "phing release", and it will upload the release to
   sourceforge and create a svn tag.
5. Tag the release in svn:
   svn cp https://semanticscuttle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/semanticscuttle/trunk https://semanticscuttle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/semanticscuttle/tags/$version
6. Write announcement mail to the SemanticScuttle mailing list
   semanticscuttle-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
7. Announce the new release in the sourceforge project news
